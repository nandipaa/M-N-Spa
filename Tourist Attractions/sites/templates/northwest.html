                            <p>Just an hour away from Johannesburg in the Cradle of Humankind is the Lesedi Cultural
                                Village. If youâ€™re looking to experience and understand the rich and diverse cultures of
                                South Africa, this is the perfect place to go.

                                Learn about the Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, Basotho, and Ndebele with different sections of the
                                village devoted to each cultural group. Representatives from each of the tribes were
                                involved in the building of the different cultural villages, and much care was taken in
                                order to make sure that each representation is as historically correct as possible.
                                Members from the different communities now live in Lesedi, helping to breathe life into
                                their cultures.

                                Guests to the Lesedi Cultural Village are treated to a tour of the five different
                                cultural areas, as well as traditional food and dancing. The aim of the village is to
                                highlight the differences in the cultures and to showcase to a wider audience the
                                interesting and beautiful cultures of South Africa.

                                Kingsley Holgate, the famous National Geographic Explorer, is one of the directors of
                                the Lesedi Cultural Village and is passionate about preserving African cultures in a
                                world that is becoming more and more Westernised.

                                Visitors are able to enjoy the music, song and warmth of Africa, and get to explore the
                                different cultures of South Africa and learn about their interesting histories and
                                traditions.

                            <p>Located in the suburb of Pienaarsdorp in Klerksdorp, this museum is comprised of a number
                                of beautiful sandstone buildings, which were previously a prison. The main building was
                                completed in 1891.

                                Found on the corners of Margarieta Prinsloo and Lombard Street, the museum exhibits the
                                early town life, social history and geological history of this area. The most famous
                                exhibit here is the Klerksdorp spheres display â€“ these small stones were found in 3
                                billion year old pyropyllite rock deposits.

                                If you are interested in visiting some of the nearby heritage sites and gold mine, this
                                can be arranged through the museum.

                            <p>This 18 hole golf course was officially opened in 1939. It was originally a 9-hole course
                                and the second 9 were only introduced in the mid-forties. It was built by the famous
                                golf club architect Bob Grimsdell.

                                Orkney has produced top stars such as Simon Hobday and Jannie Le Grange. There have been
                                many long standing trophies here, including the Pollak Cup, Directors Cup and Haggard
                                Cup.
